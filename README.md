Heading Level 2
---------------

It is best practice...

# Heading

... to leave a space before and after the heading


Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs

Keep lines left-aligned like this

  This can result in unexpected formatting problems

   Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs

This is the first line.
And this is the second line.

Many Markdown apps will ignore just hitting Enter for a line break
Does GitHub?

Instead there are a few options:

You can use 2 whitespaces after the first line  
To signal a line break

You can also use the `<br>` html tag<br>
To trigger a newline

It is not good practice to use a backlash\
To trigger a newline

Or even just hitting Enter
To trigger the next line

### Emphasis

## Bold

To **embolden** text, encase the text in a double asterixs `**`

Sometimes underscores can be used to __embolden__ text also

For best practice and compatiblity, **use asterix insetad of underscore**

## Italic

To italicise text, we encase the the text in *single asterixs*

We can also use _single underscores_, but this is **not recommended**

## Bold and Italics

We are able to ***really emphasize*** text by encasing it in a set of 3 asterixs ***

We can also use ___three underscores___

But again, ***this is not recommended***

## Blockquotes

We can be created by adding a `>` in front of a paragraph

> This is a blockquote

## Blockquotes with multiple paragraphs

> This is a multiparagraph blockquote
>
> This can be achieved by having multiple lines start with `>`

## Nested Blockquotes

> Blockquotes can contain other blockquotes
>> This is a ***nested blockquote***

## Blockquotes with other elements

> ### Blockquotes can contain all of the above!
> - **Bold Text**
> - *italicized text*
> - ***Bold and italicized text***
>> Even **Nested Blockquote** can join in

## Blockquotes Best Practices
Try to put a blank

> Before and after a blockquote

Just like this
